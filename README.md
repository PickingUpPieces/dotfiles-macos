## Credits
First of all, like most/all dotfiles, a lot of the stuff is found somewhere on the internet (basically reddit or github). Sorry for not crediting!

I've started my yabai and skhd config with https://github.com/Julian-Heng/chunkwm-yabai-config.


## Config
I love i3 (or tiling window managers in general). Thats why I tried to create an as close as possible config to get this feeling on macos.

Tools:
- Yabai: https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai
- skhd: https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd 
- spacebar: https://github.com/cmacrae/spacebar

I've tried to add the scratchpad functionality to macos. You can find two scripts (scratchpad.sh and minimize_scratchpad.sh) which open (and closing, when out of focus) certain applications.
